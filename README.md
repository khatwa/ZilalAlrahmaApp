step to contribute:

 - Package by feature. (eg: login feature should be put in a packages called login which contains the view and presenters and other classes.)
 - Make sure to format code before push new code to make it easier to others to read. (to format code automatically press `CTRL+ALT+L` in windows and linux or `Command+Option+L` on Mac)
 - New features will be considered finished when a pull request created by the contributor.
 - Before start to work on new feature make sure to run `git fetch` to get latest updates from all branches.
 - Any new feature will be created from [develop](https://github.com/khatwa/ZilalAlrahmaApp/tree/develop) branch.
 (if you have feature `X` before start to work on it make sure to 
`git checkout develop` then run `git checkout -b A` to create new branch named `X` then you can start working on it)
- New feature = new branch.
- Pushing new features to `master` and `develop` branches is prohibited to ensure code maintenance and quality.
